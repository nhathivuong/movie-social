## Technologies

- **TMDB API** â€” Provides movie data like details, ratings, and recommendations
- **Node.js** â€” JavaScript runtime for the back-end
- **Express** â€” Web framework for building the server and API routes
- **Bcrypt** â€” Hashes passwords securely before storing them
- **JWT** â€” Manages user authentication and keeps users logged in
- **MongoDB** â€” Stores user data, reviews, and lists on the server
- **Vercel** â€” Hosts the frontend
- **Render** â€” Hosts the backend

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies in both the client and server directories:
    <pre>yarn install</pre>
2. Update client fetch requests

    Remove any hardcoded backend URLs (e.g. those pointing to Render) from the client-side fetch requests, so it uses relative paths like /user.
   
4. Update the .env files in the backend and in the frontend

    In ``server/.env``, add your environment variables:
   - MONGO_URI
   - TMDB_API_KEY
   - JWT_SECRET
   
    In ``client/.env``, remove the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL value.

    In the ``client/package.json``, add ``"proxy": "http://localhost:4000",``

    This ensures that your frontend can communicate with the backend correctly during development.

6. Start the servers

    In two separate terminals:

    Start the backend
    <pre>cd server
    yarn start</pre>

    Start the frontend
    <pre>cd client 
    yarn start</pre>

    Visit http://localhost:4000 (or whatever port you want to use) in your browser.
